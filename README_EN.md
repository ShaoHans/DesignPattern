# Design Patterns Project

## Project Overview

This project includes implementations of various design patterns, aiming to help developers understand and apply design patterns to improve code maintainability and scalability. Design patterns are best practices in software development that solve common design problems.

## Design Patterns Overview

1. **Simple Factory Pattern**: Defines a class responsible for creating instances of other classes, where the created instances usually share a common parent class.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

3. **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds additional responsibilities to an object. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

4. **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

5. **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

6. **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing instance, rather than creating new instances through instantiation.

7. **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

8. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

9. **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

10. **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

11. **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: Similar to the observer pattern, it allows objects to subscribe to events and be notified when those events occur.

12. **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

13. **State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

14. **Adapter Pattern**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

15. **Memento Pattern**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.

16. **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

18. **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

19. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

20. **Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

21. **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, and supports undoable operations.

22. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Creates a chain of receiver objects for a request. Each receiver contains a reference to another receiver. If one object cannot handle the request, it passes it to the next receiver in the chain.

23. **Mediator Pattern**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

24. **Flyweight Pattern**: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

25. **Interpreter Pattern**: Given a language, defines a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

26. **Visitor Pattern**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
